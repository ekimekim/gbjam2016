In this game, you're fighting fire...with fire!
Or, y'know, by putting it out. If that's your thing.

Press A to light a fire in your current square.
Fires will burn up the fuel in the square which will mean large fires
later won't be able to burn through it, but be careful your controlled burns
don't get out of control!

You can also press B to fight the fire in your square, making it smaller or even
putting it out completely. Fighting your fires is the key to controlled backburning.

The level is over when all fire is out.
You will get points for remaining structures and trees:
10 points per building
1 point per tree

Good luck!
